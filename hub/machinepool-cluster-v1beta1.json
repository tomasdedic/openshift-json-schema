Example use case is cluster autoscaler\nwith cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out\nmachines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a\ngeneric out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be\nable to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver\nand then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.\nThis field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will\nbe interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.",

It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular\n    restrictions like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\" or \"name must be restricted\".\n    Those cannot be well described when embedded.\n 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.\n 4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity\n    during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple\n    and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.\n 5. We cannot easily change it.
