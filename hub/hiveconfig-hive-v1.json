When observing an affected metric, hive will label it with the specified metric key, and copy the value from the specified ClusterDeployment label. For example, including {\"ocp_major_version\": \"hive.openshift.io/version-major\"} will cause affected metrics to include a label key ocp_major_version with the value from the hive.openshift.io/version-major ClusterDeployment label -- e.g. \"4\". NOTE: Avoid ClusterDeployment labels whose values are unbounded, such as those representing cluster names or IDs, as these will cause your prometheus database to grow indefinitely.

Therefore you can usually set this to the config map shipped as part of OpenShift (openshift-config-managed/release-verification). \n See https://github.com/openshift/cluster-update-keys for more details. The keys within the config map in the data field define how verification is performed: \n verifier-public-key-*: One or more GPG public keys in ASCII form that must have signed the release image by digest. \n store-*: A URL (scheme file://, http://, or https://) location that contains signatures. These signatures are in the atomic container signature format. The URL will have the digest of the image appended to it as \"<STORE>/<ALGO>=<DIGEST>/signature-<NUMBER>\" as described in the container image signing format. The docker-image-manifest section of the signature must match the release image digest. Signatures are searched starting at NUMBER 1 and incrementing if the signature exists but is not valid. The signature is a GPG signed and encrypted JSON message. The file store is provided for testing only at the current time, although future versions of the CVO might allow host mounting of signatures. \n See https://github.com/containers/image/blob/ab49b0a48428c623a8f03b41b9083d48966b34a9/docs/signature-protocols.md for a description of the signature store \n The returned verifier will require that any new release image will only be considered verified if each provided public key has signed the release image digest. The signature may be in any store and the lookup order is internally defined. \n If not set, no verification will be performed.",
